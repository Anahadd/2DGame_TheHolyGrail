## How It Works
In this top-down adventure game, the player assumes the role of a courageous warrior on a mission to rescue the world from a formidable sorcerer who has enslaved its inhabitants. The destiny of the world lies in the player's hands, as they wield weapons to vanquish malevolent creatures and safeguard their fellow humans. The game's primary objective is to embark on a treacherous journey through diverse regions of the world, confronting various adversaries, all leading toward a confrontation at the sorcerer's stronghold. Along this journey, players will cross paths with NPCs who will offer quests and insights into the world's history. The ultimate aim of the player is to triumph over adversaries in epic battles and restore tranquility to the land. To accomplish this, players must defeat a range of foes and secure a Holy Grail, which is instrumental in sealing a portal and halting the enemy's attempt to conquer the planet. Players have a total of 3 lives and must overcome 60 adversaries in the initial level to progress to the second phase, which also involves interaction with an NPC. The array of enemies in the game includes wizards, capable of launching fireballs randomly and pursuing the player, along with slimes that constantly follow the player, inflicting damage. Two weapons are at the player's disposal: a shuriken to eliminate wizards with the press of the SPACE key, and a sword that can be used via mouse clicks or key presses to defeat slimes and landmines. In the initial level, players will also come across landmines that can be disarmed. Moreover, aiding civilians and clearing the planet of enemies is essential. In the second level, players must explore houses to secure the Holy Grail, which thwarts the entry of new adversaries through the PORTAL. The placement of the Holy Grail within a house is randomized. This program incorporates complex features such as a Camera, Multiple Enemies, 4 Directions, Displaying HP, and more. These advanced elements signify an effort beyond the ordinary, as substantial time was invested in compiling them.
